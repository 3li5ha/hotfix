## Description

Help Hotfix collect stargazers and avoid enemies. Collect commits to upgrade hotfix and add new features.

## Controls

Click or press space to jump. The longer you hold, the longer the jump (there is a upper threshold of course).

Jumping watchers can be destroyed by jumping on them. If you do so, you will be able to double jump.

By collecting commits, add new features to hotfix. The more features you have, the more likely you will progress in the game.
